===== Program Descriptions =====

==== Even_odd_num.pas ====
This program checks if a given number is **even** or **odd**. It uses a simple modulo operation (`mod`) to determine the number's parity.

==== High_Number.pas ====
This program takes a list of numbers and returns the **highest** number in that list. It loops through the numbers, comparing each one to find the maximum value.

==== Num_List.pas ====
This program manipulates a list of numbers, performing operations like **addition**, **subtraction**, and others, demonstrating basic list handling in Pascal.

==== Num_Pos_neg.pas ====
This simple program checks whether a number is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero** and outputs the appropriate result.

==== Other_Method_Prime_Num.pas ====
An alternative approach for determining if a number is **prime**. This program explores different methods beyond basic trial division.

==== Premeir.pas ====
Checks if a number is **prime** using a basic algorithm, testing all divisors from `1` to `n-1`. This simple approach is easy to understand for beginners.

==== Premeir_Nm.pas ====
This program also checks for **prime numbers**, but with optimized logic to reduce unnecessary checks and improve efficiency.

==== Prime_Number.pas ====
A well-known algorithm for checking whether a number is **prime**, this program uses trial division up to the square root of the number to check divisibility.

==== Program_Sqrt_Adv_Meth.pas ====
This program calculates the **square root** of a number using an **advanced method** or optimized algorithm, improving performance over the basic method.

==== Show_Prime_Numbers.pas ====
Generates and **displays all prime numbers up to a specified limit**. The program loops through numbers, checking each for primality and printing the results.

==== center_Triangle.pas ====
This program uses loops to draw a **triangle** that is **centered** on the screen. It creates an aesthetically balanced shape using simple characters.

==== idea_try.pas ====
A **test program** where different ideas, algorithms, and features are experimented with. It's a collection of code snippets and learning exercises.

==== middle_rectengle.pas ====
This program draws a **rectangle** shape, ensuring that it is **centered** on the screen. The dimensions of the rectangle can be customized.

==== new_shape_rec.pas ====
Creates and displays a **custom rectangle shape**. This program emphasizes the ability to design new shapes using basic geometric principles.

==== number_shape.pas ====
Generates **shapes based on numbers**. This could include patterns like triangles, squares, or other designs formed by numerical sequences.

==== plus_gr.pas ====
A program that demonstrates the concept of **addition-based shape generation**, where the result of arithmetic operations is used to form shapes or patterns.

==== positive_negative_num.pas ====
Checks if a number is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero**. The program outputs the result based on simple conditional checks.

===== How to Run the Programs =====

To run these programs on your local machine, follow these steps:

  1. Ensure you have a **Pascal compiler** installed (e.g., [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/) or Turbo Pascal).
  2. Open the corresponding `.pas` file in your **Pascal IDE** or text editor (such as [Geany](https://www.geany.org/) or [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/)).
  3. **Compile** and **run** the program to see the output in the console.

===== License =====

These programs are open source and can be used for **educational purposes**. You are welcome to **fork**, **modify**, and **use** the code as needed.

===== Contributing =====

Contributions are welcome! If you would like to improve or add new programs to this collection, feel free to submit **pull requests** or **open issues** for discussion.
