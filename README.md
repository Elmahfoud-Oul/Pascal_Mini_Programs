===== Program Descriptions =====

==== Even_odd_num.pas ====
This program checks whether a given number is even or odd. It uses a simple conditional check to determine the parity of the number.

==== High_Number.pas ====
This program finds the highest number from a given set of numbers. It uses a loop to iterate through the list and compares each number to find the maximum.

==== Num_List.pas ====
This program demonstrates the handling and manipulation of a list of numbers. Various operations such as addition, subtraction, and other mathematical functions are performed on the list.

==== Num_Pos_neg.pas ====
This program checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero. It uses simple comparison operators to perform the check.

==== Other_Method_Prime_Num.pas ====
An alternative approach to checking if a number is prime. This program uses a different algorithm or method from the traditional trial division approach.

==== Premeir.pas ====
A program to determine if a number is prime using a basic algorithm. It tests all divisors from 1 to `n-1` to check if any number divides `n` evenly.

==== Premeir_Nm.pas ====
This program also checks for prime numbers, but it may utilize a different optimization or approach to reduce the number of checks.

==== Prime_Number.pas ====
A prime number checking program using a common method of testing divisibility up to the square root of the given number.

==== Program_Sqrt_Adv_Meth.pas ====
A program that calculates the square root of a number using advanced methods or optimizations, improving upon the basic approach.

==== Show_Prime_Numbers.pas ====
This program prints all prime numbers up to a specified limit. It uses a prime-checking algorithm within a loop to generate the list.

==== center_Triangle.pas ====
This program draws a triangle shape centered on the screen. It uses loops to generate the shape and positions it centrally.

==== idea_try.pas ====
A simple program that explores various ideas or features in Pascal. This could be a collection of different tests or experiments.

==== middle_rectengle.pas ====
This program draws a rectangle shape and ensures that it is centered on the screen. It uses loops and conditional logic to position the rectangle.

==== new_shape_rec.pas ====
A program that draws a new shape, most likely a rectangle or another geometric figure. The design focuses on flexibility and customization of the shape.

==== number_shape.pas ====
This program creates shapes based on numbers. It may involve generating patterns or manipulating numbers to form shapes.

==== plus_gr.pas ====
A program that performs addition or arithmetic operations involving multiple numbers, potentially generating patterns or shapes based on the result.

==== positive_negative_num.pas ====
This program checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero and outputs the result accordingly.

===== How to Run the Programs =====
1. Ensure you have a Pascal compiler installed (e.g., Free Pascal or Turbo Pascal).
2. Open the respective `.pas` file in your preferred Pascal IDE or text editor.
3. Compile and run the program to see the output.
