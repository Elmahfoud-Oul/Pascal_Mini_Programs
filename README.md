## General Program Descriptions

The following programs have been developed and designed by **me**, showcasing various Pascal programming techniques:

### new_shape_rec.pas
This program print the tringle of 1 demention by user enter number of lines want**.

### Even_odd_num.pas
This program checks if a given number is **even** or **odd** using the **modulo operation** (`mod`).

### High_Number.pas
This program identifies the **highest number** in a given list by comparing each element in the list.

### Num_List.pas
This program manipulates a list of numbers, performing basic operations like **addition**, **subtraction**, and **average calculation**.

### Num_Pos_neg.pas
This program checks if a number is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero** and outputs the result accordingly.

### Other_Method_Prime_Num.pas
An alternative method for determining if a number is **prime**, exploring a different algorithm beyond trial division.

### Premeir.pas
A basic **prime number checker** that tests divisibility from `1` to `n-1`.

### Premeir_Nm.pas
An optimized version of the **prime number checker**, which tests divisibility only up to the square root of the number.

### Prime_Number.pas
A classic **prime number checking program** using trial division up to the square root.

### Program_Sqrt_Adv_Meth.pas
This program calculates the **square root** of a number using an **advanced method**, providing more accuracy and efficiency.

### Show_Prime_Numbers.pas
Generates and displays all **prime numbers up to a specified limit**, printing each prime number.

### center_Triangle.pas
Draws a **centered triangle** on the screen using loops for precise positioning.

### idea_try.pas
An experimental program that explores various ideas and algorithms, showcasing flexibility in coding.

### middle_rectengle.pas
Draws a **centered rectangle** on the screen with customizable dimensions.

### new_shape_rec.pas
Generates a **custom rectangle** shape, allowing for greater flexibility in design.

### number_shape.pas
Generates geometric shapes based on numbers, forming patterns such as triangles, squares, etc.

### plus_gr.pas
This program generates shapes or patterns based on arithmetic operations between numbers.

### positive_negative_num.pas
Checks if a number is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero** and prints the result accordingly.

## How to Run the Programs

To run these programs on your local machine:

1. Install a **Pascal compiler** (e.g., **Free Pascal** or **Turbo Pascal**).
2. Open the `.pas` file in your **Pascal IDE** or text editor.
3. **Compile** and **run** the program to see the output.
