====== Pascal Programming Collection ======

This repository contains a collection of **Pascal programs** that showcase various programming techniques. The collection includes a diverse set of programs that cover topics ranging from **basic arithmetic operations** to **geometric shapes** and **prime number checking**. 

Each program is designed to demonstrate core programming concepts and can serve as an educational resource for anyone looking to learn Pascal or improve their coding skills.

===== General Program Descriptions =====

The following programs have been developed and designed by me, demonstrating various **Pascal programming techniques**:

==== Even_odd_num.pas ====
This program checks if a given number is **even** or **odd**. It uses the **modulo operation** (`mod`) to determine the number's parity.

==== High_Number.pas ====
This program finds the **highest number** in a given list. It iterates through the numbers, comparing each one to find the maximum.

==== Num_List.pas ====
A program to manipulate a list of numbers. Operations like **addition**, **subtraction**, and **average calculation** can be performed on the list.

==== Num_Pos_neg.pas ====
Checks if a number is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero** using simple conditional checks. It provides an easy way to evaluate number signs.

==== Other_Method_Prime_Num.pas ====
This is an alternative approach for checking if a number is **prime**. Instead of the typical trial division method, this program explores other techniques for efficient prime checking.

==== Premeir.pas ====
This program checks if a number is **prime** by testing divisibility from `1` to `n-1`. It uses a basic prime-checking algorithm.

==== Premeir_Nm.pas ====
An optimized version of the **prime number checker**. This program reduces the number of checks by testing divisibility only up to the square root of the number.

==== Prime_Number.pas ====
Checks if a number is **prime** using trial division up to the square root of the given number. This is one of the most common methods for primality testing.

==== Program_Sqrt_Adv_Meth.pas ====
Calculates the **square root** of a number using an advanced method, possibly utilizing optimizations or techniques to improve the calculation.

==== Show_Prime_Numbers.pas ====
Generates and displays all **prime numbers up to a specified limit**. It loops through numbers, checks each for primality, and prints the results.

==== center_Triangle.pas ====
Draws a **triangle** that is **centered** on the screen. It uses loops to generate a balanced shape, making it visually appealing.

==== idea_try.pas ====
This program is a collection of **random code snippets** and **testing ideas**. It explores various features and learning experiments.

==== middle_rectengle.pas ====
Draws a **rectangle** that is **centered** on the screen. You can adjust the dimensions of the rectangle using simple logic.

==== new_shape_rec.pas ====
Generates a **custom rectangle shape**. It focuses on drawing flexibility and allowing for easy shape customization.

==== number_shape.pas ====
Generates shapes based on numbers, such as **triangular or square patterns**, using loops and conditional statements.

==== plus_gr.pas ====
This program generates shapes based on **arithmetic operations**, where the output of mathematical calculations is used to form patterns.

==== positive_negative_num.pas ====
Checks if a number is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero**. It evaluates the number and prints the result accordingly.

===== How to Run the Programs =====

To run these Pascal programs on your machine, follow these steps:

  1. Ensure you have a **Pascal compiler** installed, such as **Free Pascal** or **Turbo Pascal**.
  2. Open the corresponding `.pas` file in your **Pascal IDE** or text editor.
  3. **Compile** and **run** the program to see the output in the terminal or console window.
